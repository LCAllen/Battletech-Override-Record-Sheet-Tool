This project has been put on pause for now. It should work fine for most clan invasion era mechs.

Designed using MegaMekLab 0.49.17 MTF file format. If you are having problems, try updating your MegaMekLab.

NOTES:
- No support for auto-fill TICs yet. Common weapons in the same location are simply grouped together for display purposes (limited number of lines). However, TICs can be assembled manually using the GUI, however damage calculation has not been added yet.
- Only BattleMechs are supported for now, vehicles may be added at a later time.

TODO:
- MASC should be moved from equipment to adding speed directly to statline.
- Some weapons (streak SRMs, heavy lasers, etc) need to be implemented.
