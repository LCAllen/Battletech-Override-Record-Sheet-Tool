Designed using MegaMekLab 0.49.17 MTF file format. If you are having problems, try updating your MegaMekLab.

NOTES:
- No support for auto-fill TICs yet. Common weapons in the same location are simply grouped together for display purposes (limited number of lines). However, TICs can be assembled manually using the GUI, however damage calculation has not been added yet.

WIP:
- Import from MTF and GUI are complete.
- Export needs to be completed.

TODO:
- Clean up and comment code.
- Add armor pip generation, and structure pip sheets.
- Finish PDF export.
- Remove some unused code.
